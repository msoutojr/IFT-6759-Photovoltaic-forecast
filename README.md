# IFT-6759 - Projets avanc√©s en apprentissage automatique
## Project: Photovoltaic Power and Solar Radiation Forecasting

Project developed during the course IFT-6759 at the University of Montreal, in the winter semester 2022.

## Team:
* Marcos A. A. Souto Jr.
* Kodjovi Adabra
* Niranjan Niranjan
* Rui Ze Ma

## Project Goal

The main theme of the project is photovoltaic energy generation forecast. The objective is to reproduce and extend the methodology to improve the results found in the reference paper [1], , that uses a deep learning approach to predict power output from images of the sky captured with a camera installed near the solar panels.

## Instructions

* Notebooks in the main folder are independent.

* Notebooks 1 and 2 are part of the reference paper replication step.

* Notebooks 3 to 5 are the experiences developed by the group seeking to improve the performance of the model. These notebooks can be run independently.

* Some notebooks have a lightweight version for the purpose of verifying the functioning of the algorithms.

* The experiments were executed using python 3.7.
